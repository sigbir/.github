## Motivation / Mission
🔬 Image registration's importance in medical imaging is underrepresented at MICCAI, attributed to the complexity of applying deep learning to its ill-posed nature w/o real ground truth.
🦄 There is still much scope for novel methods (research gap) to improve clinical impact and there is not yet a one-fits all solution available 
🌈 The fragmented image registration community would benefit from specialised gatherings to enhance collaboration and research ties.

## Activities
🥇 Challenges: Learn2Reg ’20-‘24, OncoReg ’23-‘24 to provide much needed standardised training data and evaluation metrics, comprising 12 datasets with labels and many active leaderboards 
participate at learn2reg.grand-challenge.org 
📑 10th Workshop on Biomedical Image Registration organised by Marc Modat, Ivor Simpson, Žiga Špiclin and many more for the first time at MICCAI ’24
see https://wbir.info for programme and papers
🚀 New 2024 initiative to collect well-explained code that is applicable out-of-the-box to at least two Learn2Reg tasks ➞ github.com/sigbir
